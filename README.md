For the MNIST dataset, please use the link [HERE](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/). You need to download the raw data and the CSV converter included in the link. You'll end up with two files `mnist_test.csv` and `mnist_train.csv`, where the former is for validation set and the latter for training.
